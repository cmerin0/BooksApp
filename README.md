This repository provides a simple setup to get your Docker Compose environment up and running.

Prerequisites

Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
2. Modify the Docker Compose file (Optional)
If you need to change any configuration or environment variables, you can edit the docker-compose.yml file in this repository.

3. Start the services
Run the following command to start all services defined in the docker-compose.yml file:

bash
Copy
docker-compose up
This will pull the necessary images and start the containers.

To run the services in the background, use:

bash
Copy
docker-compose up -d
4. Access the application
Once the containers are up and running, you can access the application by visiting http://localhost:[PORT] in your browser (replace [PORT] with the actual port defined in the docker-compose.yml file).

5. Stopping the services
To stop the running services, use:

bash
Copy
docker-compose down
This will stop and remove the containers, but will keep your data volumes intact.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with missing images or dependencies, try running:
bash
Copy
docker-compose pull
This will pull the latest images before starting the services.
